# Virtual-Queue-Manager
Virtual Queue Manager is an Academic project for Web Design Lab 

In times where suddenly terms like __social distancing__ and __sanitization__ have gained popularity and have been put into practice, we thought that digitalizing waiting lines in any workplace would favor social distancing and thereby put some effort in controlling the pandemic. Hence, came along the idea of the __virtual queue manager__ where people donâ€™t necessarily have to be physically present in a waiting room to stand in a queue. They can monitor their position in the queue virtually in real time and only enter the workplace when their turn has arrived, thus preventing overcrowding of clinics, hotels and all other workplaces.
